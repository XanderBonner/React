/*
5. Forms and Lists Combined: Adding Items to a List
Problem:
Write a React component where the user can add a new task to a task list by typing the task name into an input field and clicking "Add Task."

Requirements:

Use useState to manage the task list and input value.
Render the updated task list below the input field.
Clear the input field after adding a task.

//notes for me, one we know we will have a form, thus state is needed for this and handler, wrap in div, form, label, input
//next we will have a list, but its editable so it will have state, but we do need a map. will be wraped in div (with form), ul, li

/* 
<button onClick={() => toggleStatus(toDo.id)}>Toggle Status</button>
creates a button in your React component. When the button is clicked, it calls the toggleStatus function with 
a specific task's id as its argument. Letâ€™s break it down step by step.
onClick is a React event handler, in this case it calls toggleStatus once hit

Arrow Function: () => toggleStatus(toDo.id) ensures that the toggle status function
is not executed immediatley but only when the button is clicked. If we didn't have arrow the button would click immeditaley (ie page wouldn't wait)

toDo.id value is passed to the toggleStatus function so it knows which task's tatus to change
